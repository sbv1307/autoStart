# AutoStart module.

A peace of hardware, which controls an open collector output, based on energy mesured by a AC Current Sensor Transformer (CT).

This project is about securing a waterpump.

The idea is to monitor if the waterpump is running too long, and then break the power if that's the case.

Power is controlled by IHC速. To monitor if the waterpump is running, this autoStart moduld is used.
The CT will mesure if the waterpump is running or not, at the open collector output will be connected to a IHC速 Input 24/x module.
A FunctionBlock in the IHC速 Controller will then take action, when the Input on the IHC速 Input 24/x module is held active too long, 
and schwitch OFF the power for the water pumnp.

Alternativle the AutoStart module can be used to controll a Vaccum cleaner. E.g. turn the Vaccum cleaner ON while a electric hand tool is used.
